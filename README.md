## Personal Profile

I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy, a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp for career changers. I bring a scientific background and problem solving skills with a natural ability to communicate. My motivation for becoming a software developer was a need to take on more challenging problems and be more creative in my day-to-day. Coding allows me to be inventive and collaborate so that I can learn new technologies quickly and steadily develop high quality code. 

## Motivation

During my time as a Pension Data Analyst there were many repetitive tasks that I felt could be automated. After some research, I started learning Python and SQL in my own time after work. I found this very addictive and it quickly became apparent that this was what I wanted to do. In August 2020, I decided to quit my job and start at Makers Academy. I very glad that I had the confidence to make this decision as every day I am now able to learn something new and create something exciting.

## Experience

**Profile Pensions - Pension Data Analyst (August 2019 to August 2020)**

- High level of attention to detail.
    - I produced excellent quality levels when assessing customer's current pension schemes to determine which switch drivers would apply to their situation.
- A natural communicator who encourages friendship and inclusivity within a team. 
    - Through regularly checking in with my peers and organising events outside of work I became a familiar face for colleagues to consult with     problems.
- Knowledge of pensions and investments.
    - Learning about both modern and historic schemes whilst working in a sensitive data environment and conforming to FCA regulations.  

**C Hall Arboriculture (Tree Surgery Labourer) April 2019 - August 2019**
    - Working in a team of two, we had be completely in tune with one another to safely and efficiently dismantle trees. These communication skills have been invaluable as a developer.
    
**Borough Market (Stall Manager) September 2018 - April 2019**
    - As stall manager I communicated effectively witch customers and other staff to give great customer service. I was responsible for sales, preparing the food and stock management.

## Skills

The communication skills gained through my work in hospitality, retail and tree surgery have been invaluable when learning to code. During my time doing tree surgery, having clear communication with my colleagues and trusting their abilities was vital as our lives were often in each other’s hands. At Makers, these skills enabled me to learn more in pairing sessions, give and take feedback objectively as well as getting the most out of my peers in group projects.

Studying science has given me many transferrable skills relevant to coding. A logical style of solving problems is imperative to steady progress. In my Masters and as a Pension Data Analyst I developed advanced mathematical skills that help me to solve coding problems logically. Both disciplines involve reading other’s work and using their findings to alter your course of action and avoid duplication. Documenting the process through tests and notes is therefore important to make your work easy for others to follow.

## Education

#### Makers Academy August 2020 - November 2020

- Test-driven high-quality code writing
    - Please see my projects mentioned above for examples of my code quality.
- Agile development process
    - Planning sprints and dividing tasks amongst the group. Using reflections on previous sprints to guide the next.
- Pair programming
    - Daily 4 hour sessions taught me how to learn from others but also how to teach and get the most out of people.
- OOP 
    - Became competent in Ruby and JS
    
- Other
    - Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL
    - Web Frameworks/Libraries: Ruby on Rails, React, Sinatra
    - Databases: Postgres
    - Testing Suites: RSpec, Jasmine, React Testing Library
    - CI/CD: Travis, Heroku

#### University of Bristol - Integrated Chemistry Masters MChem (2014 to 2018)

- Solved difficult problems and developed a deep understanding of a mathematical, technical subject. 
    - Achieved an overall mark of 77% (first-class honours), receiving the School of Chemistry Commendation in the second and third years.
- Self-directed learning. 
    - Self-led 7 month full-time research project into gold catalysis.
    - This involved designing experiments and analysing the resulting data from analytical instruments (NMR, GCMS and Mass spectrometry) to find the underlying trends. 
    - Arguments were then formed based on this analysis and supported by theory obtained from reading the relevant academic literature. 

#### The Ashcombe School (2006 - 2013)

A Levels: Maths (A), Chemistry (A), Physics (B), Music AS (B)
GCSE's: 6 x A* , 3 x A

## Interests

I am interested in all things food related; I make my own cured meats and brew my own beer & wine. I
enjoy keeping fit by running, cycling and playing football. I am a keen musician and write and
record my own music loosely based on the style of blues.
