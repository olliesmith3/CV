## Oliver Smith

An aspiring full-stack junior developer with a background in science. Since beginning to teach myself to code via online resources in janurary 2020 I have become almost okay at it. I decided to change careers into tech as it will enable me to use my logical skills and creative drive to build things simultaeously.

## Experience

**Profile Pensions** (August 2019 to July 2020)  
Pension Data Analyst

- In this role I managed a large set of customers, taking them through the pension advice service. I used each customer's data to compare the suitablity of their current plans and determine the relevant switch drivers ready to feed into the auto-advice process. Working closely with the tech team, I highlighted issues and suggested improvements to the software and auto-advice process as a whole. This job developed my analytical skills and my knowledge of retirement planning and investments; however, it became clear to me that building the software was much more exciting which led to me learning to code in the evenings and eventually starting at Makers Academy.

**(June 2018 to August 2019)**

- During this year I worked as a tree surgeon and had a range of jobs in the food & drinks industry. I brewed in a brewery, worked on a stall at Borough market and cooked at multiple food pop-ups including a street food barbecue stall "Quirky Dough" that I set up with my friend. These jobs were fullfilling and enjoyable however lacked the satisfaction gained from solving a really hard problem that I was used to from my degree.

## Skills

#### Teaching myself to code

- After realising that writing code would be the optimum career for me, I thought I could teach myself the necessary skills in my spare time and completed all SQL and Python courses on Codecademy. I enjoyed doing this so much that I began to feel as if I was wasting my time in my current job so decided to quit my job and join Makers Academy.


#### Research & Development

I believe the reason I instantly felt at home when learning to code was its parrallels with lab research. My degree essentially boiled down to reading what experiments other people had done and then applying those concepts to my own experiments and problems (whilst learning a few other tools such as maths to help me do the job along the way). When building my first program in ruby, I realised the skills were the same just the medium had changed from atoms to computers.

## Hobbies & Interests

I am interested in all things food related; I make my own cured meats and brew my own beer & wine. I
enjoy keeping fit by running, cycling and playing football. I am a keen musician and write and
record my own music loosely based on the style of blues.
